If you followed [Part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-19-building-this-blog-part-1-hello-world %}) of this blog series, then you should have a freely hosted website that you can build with any html, css, and images you want.  I was very happy when I got to this step, but I wanted more.  I also wanted an easy way to create a blog to demonstrate my super big tech brain.  For this need, I started researching static site generators.  

These are light frameworks meant to add simple functions to help you generate a static website with the fewest lines of code as possible.  They might have features like templating, markdown support, an easy way to create blog posts, AWS S3 deployment, circle ci integration, and a way to share themes.  Some examples are [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), [hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo), [gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) and [hakyll](https://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll).  The one I chose to use is officially supported by github pages, and is the most popular static site generator according to [staticgen.com](https://www.staticgen.com/).  I chose this one:

Assuming that you are comfortable with the command line, and have a development environment with ruby, getting started with jekyll is fast.  From within your `.github.io` repository directory, run the following:

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install bundler jekyll
$ jekyll new .
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

Now you should have jekyll server running local on port 4000.  Visit `localhost:4000` in your browser of choice, and you should see this:

Wow! Look at that!  You now have a working blog that you can deploy to your github.io page.  This already looks very close to my websited because I use jekyll's default theme called [minima]().   This theme provides a responsive header, footer, and body for blogs.  Check out the "Welcome to Jekyll" autogenerated blog post in your browser, and witness the beautiful synatx highlighted code snippet!

The source for this blog post is actually a markdown file in the `_posts` directory that the `jekyll new` command created.  This is my favorite static websited generator tool, as it is really convient to be able to write technical blog posts in markdown.  In fact, both this blog post and [the last one](/2018/03/19/building-this-blog-part-1-hello-world) are generated from markdown files.  Lets take a look at this example blog post and try chaning the name from "Welcome to Jekyll!" to "Welcome to Your Worst Nighmare!!!".  At the top of the markdown file, you should see something like this:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"
date:   2018-4-10 13:04:55 -700
categories: jekyll update
---
```

This section is called Front Matter, and its how jekyll allows you to set valuables for variables to be used in the layout.  In this case, that means we can edit this `title` value to be the new name we want!  If you edit this value, and then refresh your browser, then you should see the title of your blog post has already been updated. Take a look in the generated `_site` directory, you can see the html that jekyll generated in order to serve your blog content.  The `bundle exec jekyll serve` command tells jekyll to take everything from the current directory and build a static website in the `_site` directory.  Say you leave the jekyll server running and you change the name of the blog post in the `_posts` directory, then the corresponding html file in `_site/jekyll/update` will be automatically updated.

Jekyll uses a yml configuration (`_config.yml`) file for several options like the aformentioned minima theme. There should be a `title:` key, try updating that file to say "Your pretty fine title".  If you leave the server running and try refreshing to see your title change, you will notice that nothing changed!  This is because you need to restart the jekyll server for any changes in `_config.yml` to take effect.
