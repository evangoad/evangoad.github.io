It began as a simple and free way to host a personal blog, and documentation for your open source projects. Now Github Pages is used by huge companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Netflix, and hosts large open source projects like electronjs.org and jekyllrb.com.
Jekyll, to this day, is still the static site generator (SSG) recommeded and documented for github pages.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://evangoad.github.io/top/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://evangoad.github.io/top/about/</guid><description>I am an experienced Software Engineer working in the web over the last 9 years. I have worked as a Full Stack Engineer with Procore, Liquid Planner, and ShareGrid as member of their agile teams. In the last 3 years, I began leading DevOps projects, and working as a Site Reliability Engineer. I am always looking for opportunities to make the web more reliable, understandable, and observable. Some of my side projects include this blog, and devenv, my automation tool for my development environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
