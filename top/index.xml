I have worked as a Full Stack Engineer with Procore, Liquid Planner, and ShareGrid as member of their agile teams. In the last 3 years, I began leading DevOps projects, and working as a Site Reliability Engineer. I am always looking for opportunities to make the web more reliable, understandable, and observable. Some of my side projects include this blog, and devenv, my automation tool for my development environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
