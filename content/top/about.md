I am an experienced Software Engineer working in the web over the last 9 years.  I have worked as a Full Stack Engineer with Procore, Liquid Planner, and ShareGrid as member of their agile teams.  In the last 3 years, I began leading DevOps projects, and working as a Site Reliability Engineer.  I am always looking for opportunities to make the web more reliable, understandable, and observable.  Some of my side projects include this blog, and [devenv](evangoad.github.io/devenv), my automation tool for my development environment.

I enjoy photography, films, and talking about music.  I really enjoy learning about new music I've never heard before.
